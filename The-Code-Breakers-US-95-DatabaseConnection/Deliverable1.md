## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review (Answer as a team)
#### Screen Cast Link:  
- [Link to video](https://youtu.be/QLfGunjZyLQ)

#### Sprint Review Questions:
- **What value did you create during this Sprint?**
    > We fixed some small bugs, cleared up the topic for the app by changing it from a notbeook/scheduler tool to a course planning/teacher scheduling tool.

- **Do you feel you worked enough and met expectations?**
    > We feel like the expectations for us from the sprint were met, and that our work was sufficient.

- **Did you meet the customers’ expectations? Why or why not?**
    > Our product meets some of the customers expectations, but we definitely have some work to do during the next sprint.

---

### Sprint Retrospective (Answer as a team, based on evidence)
Provide clear answers based on your team’s actual data and performance.

- **Did you meet your Sprint Goal?**
    > Our sprint goal was almost completed, we had some setbacks in regards on clarity to who was doing what tasks,
      and people not being accountable for the work they said they would do.

- **Did you complete all User Stories in the Sprint Backlog?**
    > No, we had one User Story that was leftover at the end, but it is one that had almost been complete.

- **If not, what went wrong?**
    > There were some miscommunication on who would complete a task that was crucial to a User Story, making it not get completed.

- **Did you work at a consistent rate or velocity?**
    > We would say that we were pretty close to being consistent, and it is possible that all together we were consistently
      working on the project, but the Taiga shows dips down in the expected line for our burndown chart. Taiga is not necessarily
      a good representation of when people are working on stuff as the chart only changes once code is done, but in Github and
      looking at the commits, we can also see that our work was nearly at a consistent rate the only thing that throws off the commits
      is that we don't know how much work was done between them, and on which days.

- **Did you deliver business value and what was it?**
    > Yes, we made it easier to navigate as a teacher scheduling tool, and we also removed bugs that affected the project.
      Another thing that adds business value is the database implementation for login, allowing the users to login.

- **Did you follow the Scrum process (e.g., moving tasks, updating boards, etc.)?**
    > Yes, we updated our Taiga board in accordance with the rules of the sprint, making sure that nobody did unneccessary work.

- **Is there anything you could improve for the next Sprint? (For the last Sprint mention what you would do if you were to continue)**
    > We feel like we need to communicate more in the project, and we also need to make sure that when we make a pull request there
      are no/as little conflicts as possible.

- **How do you feel about the Sprint? (Team optimism pulse)**
    > We all feel like there are things that we need to work on for the next sprint for sure, but overall we
      think next sprint will be better now that we know more.

### Team Member [Logan Ford]

#### Consistency and Effort:

#### GitHub Links to Work:

    - [Commit 1](https://github.com/amehlhase316/The-Code-Breakers/commit/fcfadf8d31bfba9bbaf979dbd157ff685e5b1310)
         - This commit removed the look and feel option for memoranda as it wasn't clear what it was doing, and it seemed easier to remove rather
            than make it function how it was meant to function.
    - [Commit 2](https://github.com/amehlhase316/The-Code-Breakers/commit/2fd6edfecf6a3011c73c61cf78514a8b7c80b946)
         - This commit was for the creation of the login and register pages for teach memoranda, it is supposed to be the way the login function
            would be implemented to use this for logging in.
    - [Commit 3](https://github.com/amehlhase316/The-Code-Breakers/commit/1233c4095a85a151d89212f755a4590e1ad7e310)
         - This commit was for the first of many pull requests that I accepted as the Git master, and after doing this first sprint I think we need
            Dev to be protected as well to avoid having to revert any issues that go unnoticed as well as people pushing without consulting the Git master.
    - [Commit 4](https://github.com/amehlhase316/The-Code-Breakers/commit/3e7937baaf6bcd46900460c01bb8b7dbc7b83b6d)
         - This commit was for making sure that pulling up the preferences section in the tool bar actually works and is functional.

- **GitHub Pull Requests (Up to 3)**
    - [PR 1](https://github.com/amehlhase316/The-Code-Breakers/pull/6) - This pull request was for user Story #16 to bring it into the dev branch.
    - [PR 2](https://github.com/amehlhase316/The-Code-Breakers/pull/11) - This pull request was a revert on a commit, as there had been some issues with it initially.
    - [PR 3](https://github.com/amehlhase316/The-Code-Breakers/pull/20) - This was the final pull request for sprint 1, pulling dev into main.
