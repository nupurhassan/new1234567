## 1: Basic Information (To be completed before you start Sprint)

### Project Information:
- **Topic Chosen**: Course Instructor Scheduler
- **Sprint Number**: 2
- **Scrum Master**: Joseph Lugaho
- **Git Master**: Jacob Cox

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3):
For our sprint plan we are going to add more functionality to the project and make sure that the customer can see the
changes incorporated in the project. We are going to make sure our code is clean and that all our user stories are done
by the end of the sprint. We want to make lots of progress on actually implementing the features that the course instructor
scheduler needs to have during this sprint.

#### Sprint Goal:
- **Sprint Goal**: Start making the project look different from the out of the box product, as well as make it feel unique and not just
                   a copy of the original project with some extra flair. We will also be making sure it is more like a scheduler.

#### Product Backlog & Sprint Backlog:
- **User Stories in Product Backlog**: 1
- **User Stories in Sprint Backlog**: 9

#### Sprint Planning Questions:
- **Why did you select these User Stories for this Sprint?**
    > These stories were selected to be more tailored to the audience of this project. We also selected ones that will change
      the look and feel to be more our own style.

 #### Sprint Planning Questions:
- **Why do you think you can complete them in this Sprint?**
    > There are more points for the user stories this sprint, but since we have learned more about the project we believe that
      this increase in difficulty should not pose a problem.

- **How do these User Stories align with the Sprint Goal?**
    > They will change the product to be more unique and not just a copy of the original by creating extra functionality
      and a different style than the original product.

- **Do you have a clear idea of the tasks needed to complete these User Stories? (If not, please notify via Slack.)**
    > Yes, we have created multiple tasks for each user story that defines the tasks needed to be completed as well as
      create acceptance tests to make sure we meet all the requirements.

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review (Answer as a team)
#### Screen Cast Link:  
- [Link to the video](https://youtu.be/-t1QgkY2dlY)


#### Sprint Review Questions:
- **What value did you create during this Sprint?**
    > We added more features to the app that were a part of the user stories that we had.

- **Do you feel you worked enough and met expectations?**
    > We could have performed better and tried to put in more effort, and this sprint felt more disconnected than the first one as there was not much communication from all the members.

- **Did you meet the customers’ expectations? Why or why not?**
    > No, there were a few user stories that went unfinished and if I were a customer I would have expected more work to be done given what was present on the sprint board at the beginning of the sprint.

---

### Sprint Retrospective (Answer as a team, based on evidence)
Provide clear answers based on your team’s actual data and performance.

- **Did you meet your Sprint Goal?**
    > No, the sprint goal was not met as we had many unfinished tasks and some that were not even started.
    
- **Did you complete all User Stories in the Sprint Backlog?**
    > No, there were stories that people were working on that went unfinished due to either time constraints or other reasons, which meant that not all the user stories were able to be completed.

- **If not, what went wrong?**
    > Maybe there was some miscommunication, and not everyone was participating with their full effort.

- **Did you work at a consistent rate or velocity?**
    > Our work was not done at a consistent rate because there were many tasks that went stagnant for a little after they were assigned and didn't get completed before the end of the sprint.

- **Did you deliver business value and what was it?**
    > Kind of, there could have been more done during the sprint, but the completed functionality was good and made the product better with the features that were added.

- **Did you follow the Scrum process (e.g., moving tasks, updating boards, etc.)?**
    > Yes, even though the tasks were slowly moving, they were updated on the Taiga board and we made sure to update it as we were going.

- **Is there anything you could improve for the next Sprint? (For the last Sprint mention what you would do if you were to continue)**
    > We need to be better at coordinating on what we have to get done for the sprint because it's possible there was too much for people to complete their tasks. Also we can work on asking for help/clarification when trying to understand the project as it is an important aspect of the class.

- **How do you feel about the Sprint? (Team optimism pulse)**
    > We feel like there was a lot that could have been done during this sprint and we were just not able to achieve that goal. We understand we have a lot to improve on and for the next sprint we are going to make sure that is the case.

### Burndown Chart (For Sprint 2 and 3):
Please include a screenshot of your Burndown chart here, and provide a detailed analysis. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae8125c8-bacd-4ab6-b890-64384b64c792)


- **Analysis of Burndown**: _Why does it look like this? What would you improve?_

> It looks like this because we were not completely active during the whole sprint, and we need to work on improving our work effort for the next sprint. There is also some work that was done during the sprint that is not shown because of the spring break that bisected the two weeks we had for the sprint.
