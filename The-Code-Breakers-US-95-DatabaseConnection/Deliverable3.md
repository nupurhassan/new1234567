## 1: Basic Information (To be completed before you start Sprint)

### Project Information:
- **Topic Chosen**: Course Instructor Scheduler
- **Sprint Number**: 3
- **Scrum Master**: Jacob Cox
- **Git Master**: Joseph Lugaho

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3):
For our sprint plan we are going to try to finish up the tasks/user stories that were left unfinished in sprint 2. We are going to make sure our code is clean and that along with user stories being done by the end of this sprint, we are also going to make sure that appropriate user stories have adequate testing and are reviewed by another person. This should include more functionality/features that a course instructor would need.

#### Sprint Goal:
- **Sprint Goal**: Our goal is to give the project the proper functionality that follows the UI changes made in the last sprint. We want to make sure that everyone contributes a fair amount and that it looks even more like its own app and not like the original.

#### Product Backlog & Sprint Backlog:
- **User Stories in Product Backlog**: 0
- **User Stories in Sprint Backlog**: 3

#### Sprint Planning Questions:
- **Why did you select these User Stories for this Spring?**
    > Some of them were brought over from sprint 2, and the other ones were features that we belived would fit in with the tasks we were wanting to complete to          keep up with our goals for the project.

 #### Sprint Planning Questions:
- **Why do you think you can complete them in this Sprint?**
    > Since it is the third sprint we should have a better grasp of how long tasks should take us so we should be able to complete the ones that we are assigning        ourselves.

- **How do these User Stories align with the Sprint Goal?**
    > These user stories align with our sprint goal by implementing the functionality of a course instructor scheduler. These tasks will help solidify our project       as a course scheduler and not like the base memoranda project.

- **Do you have a clear idea of the tasks needed to complete these User Stories? (If not, please notify via Slack.)**
    > Yes, we have a clear idea on what is needed to complete our tasks for this sprint and make make our project more complete. We also have our acceptance tests that helped us create tasks for each user story.

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review (Answer as a team)
#### Screen Cast Link:  
- [Video](https://youtu.be/_SZ4DYHVAQ4)

#### Sprint Review Questions:
- **What value did you create during this Sprint?**
    > Our team created value to this project by creating the ability to edit and delete courses, color code them for readability, and created the ability for the user
      to change their username and password while using the program.

- **Do you feel you worked enough and met expectations?**
    > Our team did not meet expectations as there were many things our team could have done differently to add value to the project.

- **Did you meet the customers’ expectations? Why or why not?**
    > No, we did not complete all the user stories that we had laid out at the beginning of the sprint.

---

### Sprint Retrospective (Answer as a team, based on evidence)
Provide clear answers based on your team’s actual data and performance.

- **Did you meet your Sprint Goal?**
    > No, there were many uncompleted and even unstarted user stories.

- **Did you complete all User Stories in the Sprint Backlog?**
    > No, there was one that was not even started.

- **If not, what went wrong?**
    > Our team did not work consistently on the sprint which meant that some tasks did not get touched.

- **Did you work at a consistent rate or velocity?**
    > No, a lot of the work on the sprint was done in segments rather than over a consistent time.

- **Did you deliver business value and what was it?**
    > Yes, there is new functionality for courses and changing user credentials.

- **Did you follow the Scrum process (e.g., moving tasks, updating boards, etc.)?**
    > Yes, when user tasks were being worked on they were moved according to what stage they were in.

- **Is there anything you could improve for the next Sprint? (For the last Sprint mention what you would do if you were to continue)**
    > Work on more user stories that are related to the expectations of the customer.

- **How do you feel about the Sprint? (Team optimism pulse)**
    > This sprint has been rough, and was one of our sprints with the least communication and urgency for people completing their tasks.

### Burndown Chart (For Sprint 2 and 3):
Please include a screenshot of your Burndown chart here, and provide a detailed analysis. 
- **Analysis of Burndown**: _Why does it look like this? What would you improve?_

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec358182-9df2-4cdd-b12c-07bd6953bbcd)

> Our burndown chart looks like this because there was not much work done consistently which makes the bar dip when things were completed instead of being linear.
